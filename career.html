            <h2><span class="terminal-prompt">~/</span> My Journey Ahead</h2>
            <p>
                My path in cybersecurity is just getting started, and I'm excited about where it's heading. 
                I'm not just looking to land a job – I'm building a career where I can continuously learn, 
                break things (ethically), and contribute to making systems more secure.

            <h3>📚 Immediate Goals: Graduate School</h3>
            <p>
                After completing my undergraduate degree, I'm planning to pursue a <span class="highlight">Master of Science 
                in Cybersecurity at Iowa State University</span>. I want to dive deep into research, specifically in 
                <span class="highlight">wireless security</span> or <span class="highlight">hardware security</span>. 
                There's something fascinating about the intersection of physical devices and security vulnerabilities – 
                whether it's breaking into wireless protocols or finding hardware exploits in embedded systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Graduate school isn't just about the degree for me. It's about pushing the boundaries of what we know 
                about security, contributing original research, and developing expertise in areas that are becoming 
                increasingly critical as IoT and embedded devices proliferate everywhere.

            <h3>💼 Long-Term Career Vision</h3>
            <p>
                After my master's, I see myself working in a role where I can put my offensive security skills to use – 
                whether that's as a <span class="highlight">Red Team Operator</span>, 
                <span class="highlight">Security Engineer</span>, or <span class="highlight">Penetration Tester</span>. 
                I want to be the person organizations call when they need someone to think like an attacker and find 
                vulnerabilities before the bad guys do.
            </p>
            <p>
                What excites me most is the constant evolution of security. Every day brings new challenges, new attack 
                vectors, and new defenses. I want to be at the forefront of that, whether I'm working for a cutting-edge 
                tech company, a security consulting firm, or helping defend critical infrastructure.

            <p>
                Security isn't just a career for me – it's a passion. I plan to stay active in the community by:

                These aren't just extracurriculars – they're how I stay sharp, network with amazing people, and give 
                back to the community that's taught me so much.

        <div class="section">
            <h2><span class="terminal-prompt">~/</span> The Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>
                I'm not looking to just clock in and clock out. I want a career where every day presents a new puzzle 
                to solve, where I'm constantly learning, and where my work makes systems and people more secure. 
                Whether I'm researching novel attack vectors in grad school, breaking into client systems as a pentester, 
                or competing in CTFs on weekends, I want to be someone who's always pushing forward in this field.
